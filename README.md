Document Structure
------------------

The content of every individual lecture should go into the corresponding file in
the [``lectures``](lectures) directory. E.g., the scribes for the first lecture
are in the file [``lectures/lecture_1.tex``](lectures/lecture_1.tex).

The main file that includes all lectures into a single document is
[``main.tex``](main.tex).

Compilation
-----------

To compile the lecture notes locally on your computer, for example, run:
```pdflatex main.tex```

The latest version of the document is automatically generated with every push to
the repository by the [ShareLaTeX Cloud
Compiler](https://www.sharelatex.com/github/) and available
[here](https://www.sharelatex.com/github/repos/bkragl/CS-601_S16/builds/latest/output.pdf).
