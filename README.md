Collaborative lecture notes

[Course website](https://courses.app.ist.ac.at/index.php?id=133)

The content of every individual lecture should go into the corresponding file in
the [``lectures``](lectures) directory. E.g., the scribes for the first lecture
are in the file [``lectures/lecture_1.tex``](lectures/lecture_1.tex).

The main file that includes all lectures into a single document is
[``main.tex``](main.tex). To compile the lecture notes, for example, run:
```pdflatex main.tex```
